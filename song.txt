It's gonna be okay
Everyone needs a bad day
Remember you told me
You're not alone, just pick up the phone
And call me whenever you're feeling lonely
Remember you told me
You're not alone, just pick up the phone
No sky is forever blue
Things bloom whenever they've seen the rain
Your thoughts lie, but I know the truth (I know the truth)
The best days are ahead of you (ahead of you)
Tomorrow isn't your yesterday
